## Installation / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

> ![Delete this instructional comment][comments-delete-image] Replace these instructions with installation procedures applicable to your product.

```shell
$ npm install product-name
```

If your team prefers Yarn:

```sh
$ yarn add product-name
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

## Usage

`product-name` allows users to do `feature-one`, `feature-two`, and `feature-three`.

### `feature-one` sample code

```

```

### `feature-two` sample code

```

```

### `feature-three` sample code

```

```


## Development
> [![PRs Welcome][badge-prs-welcome-image]][badge-prs-welcome-url] Interesting in development contributions? Great! [Check out our Contributing Guidelines][contributing-url] for details.

### Built With

List main libraries, frameworks used including versions (React, Angular etc.). Automate this list dynamically in order to keep it up-to-date.

### Prerequisites

What is needed to set up the dev environment? For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. Provide installation instructions using dependency management tools. (If dependency management is not available, include download links.)

### Set up a development environment

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
cd your-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when using the project.

### API Reference

If your product depends on external APIs, link to the API documentation.

If your product **is an API or micro-service** itself, link to its OpenAPI/Swagger specification.

### Data persistence

Explain what database/datastore (and version) is used (if any). Provide

 * Download links,
 * Datastore design and schemas, relations etc...

## DevSecOps

Briefly state the continuous integration/continuous delivery (or deployment) services you use for product delivery, including all quantity gates.

### Build

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Test

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
```

### Deploy/Publish

Give instructions on how to build and release a new version.
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Style guide

Explain your code style and show how to validate and fix non-compliant source code.

## API Reference

If your product depends on external APIs, link to the API documentation.

If your product **is an API or micro-service** itself, link to its OpenAPI/Swagger specification.

## Version and Change Log

 Link to your version specification. If you don't have formal specification, use [Semantic Versioning][semver-url], and declare the latest version here. For the versions available, see the [link to tags on this repository](/tags).

 Finally, link to the Change Log, which describes that features, fixes, and breaking changes introduced over time, with links to their Git commits SHAs.

 The latest version of `product-name` is `0.0.0`. View the [CHANGELOG][changelog-url] for details.
